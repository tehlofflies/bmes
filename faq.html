                <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

                <p>If you have any questions about the BME curriculum or other BME related issues, please submit them <a href="http://orion.bme.columbia.edu/bmes/contact.html">here</a>. We will post responses to common questions here.</p>

                <br>

                <p><b>How can I get involved and do research in a lab?</b></p>
                <p>Professors are always looking for undergrads to help out in their labs - just look up the different labs on the BME department website, find a project that you're interested in, and then go talk to the PI (Principal Investigator - the professor in charge of it) to see how you can get involved.</p>

                <br>

                <p><b>How do I decide on a track within the biomedical engineering major?</b></p>
                <p>

                Each of the three tracks in the Columbia University BME department will prepare you equally well for a career in medicine, research, or industry. The cell and tissue track has a focus on the biomaterial and chemistry of living tissue and includes the following research faculty: Helen Lu, Clark Hung, Lance Kam, Samuel Sia, Barclay Morrison, and Gordana Vunjak-Novakovic. The biomechanics track is geared toward students that are interested in learning the interaction between bone and muscle and includes the following research faculty: Ed Guo, Gerard Ateshian, Henry Hess, and others. The biomedical imaging track is designed for students that want an understanding of the principles behind popular imaging modalities such as MRI, ultrasound, and PET - faculty include: Andreas Hielscher, Elizabeth Hillman, Andrew Laine, Paul Sajda, and Elisa Konofagou.</p>

                <br>

                <p><b>Where do BME students end up after they graduate?</b></p>
                <p>Students who graduate with a degree in biomedical engineering have a variety of options available to them, including industry, graduate school, and medicine. Those who go into industry will most likely be working in teams with other engineers or other professionals. Biomedical engineers may also be involved in research and development projects. However, many people choose to further their education by getting a master's degree or a Ph.D. This makes it possible to get higher-level jobs in industry or do independent research. Finally, a significant portion of BME undergrads are pre-meds. Biomedical engineering is a popular major for eventual medical school students because of its relevance to medicine.</p>
